      <h2>Swahili biryani</h2>
      <p>
        A quick search for biriyani on google and you’re bound to end up with a
        gazillion recipes to choose from hailing from India or Pakistan. Now I’m
        not here to start a food war but have you tried Swahili biriyani? From
        the East African Coast? No? Boy oh boy are you missing out on this
        flavour-packed easy main course!
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me see how to best describe this. Chicken. Caramelised onions. Rich
        sauce. Rice. Those would be the 4 words I would use to put what Swahili
        chicken biriyani is into perspective. I know that a lot of people in the
        West have never tried this before but please, please for the love of
        sweet taste buds, please try this at least once? It’s not that difficult
        at all, and you can brag about making something all the way from Kenya
