	<h2>Teriyaki steak quick and easy</h2>
	<p>A quick and easy, very tasty version of the teriyaki steak-on-a-stick 
	that you get from a Chinese restaurant. It's great as an appetizer or 
	even as finger food at a football watching party! I also use it for 
	just plain old regular steaks to grill! Either way, it's awesome! 
	My uncle came up with the recipe and gave it to my mother, who passed it on to me! LOVE it!</p>
